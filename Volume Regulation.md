## Introduction
1. The regulation of volume involves the regulation of plasma volume and blood pressure
	1. ![[Pasted image 20230513160334.png|300]]
	2. Definition: volume regulation is the adjustment of plasma volume **and** BP in order to maintain adequate perfusion of tissues
		1. The term "volume regulation" *implies* only the regulation of plasma volume
			1. However, adequate tissue perfusion requires that plasma *moves*
			2. Movement of plasma (i.e. circulation) throughout body requires maintenance of **BP**
		2. Effective Circulating Volume
			1. *implies* that for adequate tissue perfusion → plasma volume + BP must be maintained
			2. ∴ volume regulation = *effective circulating volume* regulation

## Effective Circulating Volume
### Plasma Volume
1. Increased through two mechanisms: Resorption of Sodium and Resorption of Water (with or without sodium)
		1. ![[Pasted image 20230513160808.png|300]]
	2. Recall: plasma volume = extracellular component of blood volume
	3. Regulation of Plasma Volume
		1. Signals that act at different sites of the nephron to affect resorption of sodium and water
			1. Proximal Tubule & Collecting Tubule
#### Sodium Resorption
1. Primary mechanism of increasing plasma volume
2. Resorption of sodium occurs in proximal tubule & collecting tubule
	1. In proximal tubule → causes resorption of water
	2. In collecting tubule → only sodium gets resorbed (without water)
3. First and best defense against volume depletion
	1. Similar to administration of NaCl
		1. As sodium is resorbed in the proximal tubule, water follows → i.e. this is isotonic
		2. As sodium and water are added to the plasma → plasma volume is substantially increased because the sodium and water remain in the extracellular compartment
#### Water Resorption
1. Additional mechanism of increasing plasma volume
2. Resorption of water occurs in the collecting tubule
	1. Occurs without sodium or another solute
	2. Not as effective at increasing plasma volume
3. Second-line defense → employed only when volume is very low
	1. Similar to administration of D5W
		1. 1 L of D5W only increases plasma volume by 80 mL
		2. When water is resorbed from collecting tubules and added to plasma → osmotic forces cause water to redistribute among all three body water components → leaving little for plasma compartment

### Blood Pressure
1. BP = Cardiac Output x Peripheral Vascular Resistance

## Regulation
1. Occurs in three steps: Monitoring, Signaling, and Action at Targets
	1. Monitoring: done by baroreceptors at several points throughout the body → respond to change in BP
		1. Primary monitors involved in volume regulation
	2. Signaling: three types of signals which respond to stimulation by the baroreceptors
		1. RAAS
		2. Sympathetic Activation
		3. ADH
	3. Action at Targets: These three signals act at three main targets to increase plasma volume & BP: Kidney, Heart, and Vasculature
		1. Action at kidney → plasma volume
		2. Action at Heart and Vasculature → BP

### Monitoring
1. Recall that plasma osmolality is consistent at all points throughout the body
	1. ∴ osmoregulation only requires one detection point
2. Because perfusion differs from one area to another → volume regulation requires multiple detection points → multiple baroreceptors
	1. Carotid sinuses
	2. Afferent arterioles of the glomerulus
3. Low blood pressure can be associated with low, normal or high plasma volume
	1. Usually BP and plasma volume correlate because a drop in plasma volume causes a drop in BP
		1. this occurs in dehydration and blood loss
	2. When there is a failure of the plasma to move or circulate through the vasculature leading to a low BP → the associated plasma volume can be normal or elevated
		1. e.g. Heart failure, liver failure, AVM, [[Sepsis]]
4. Regardless of the plasma volume, the response to decreased BP is the same
	1. Signals act at the heart, vasculature and kidney to increase blood pressure **and** plasma volume → beneficial to help restore adequate tissue perfusion
	2. Can potentially have negative consequences
		1. Increasing plasma volume in patients with normal or elevated plasma volume → increase venous hydrostatic pressure → pulmonary and/or peripheral edema

### Signaling
1. Several signals act to increase plasma volume and BP
	1. These three signals are triggered by baroreceptors to increase volume
	2. ![[Pasted image 20230513162601.png|300]]
2. Renin-Angiotensin II-Aldosterone System
	1. Series of enzymatic reactions → release of angiotensin II & aldosterone (important components in volume regulation)
		1. ![[Pasted image 20230513162721.png|300]]
		2. Renin release is stimulated by conditions a/w low volume
			1. Low pressure in afferent arteriole
			2. Decreased delivery of sodium to distal tubule
			3. Increased sympathetic activity
		3. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor
			1. Also stimulates adrenal gland to release aldosterone
			2. > ACE-I are medications that decrease formation of angiotensin II → decreasing vasoconstriction without increasing heart rate
3. Sympathetic Activation
	1. Low volume → sympathetic system activation → stimulation of nerves to target organs → release of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine
4. ADH
	1. Hormone produced by the posterior pituitary gland
	2. Primary function → maintenance of plasma osmolality
	3. Secondary role in volume regulation
5. RAAS & sympathetic activity = primary signals of volume regulation → activated together
	1. ADH only employed when volume is *extremely low*
	2. If ADH is active then RAAS and sympathetic activation are already engaged

### Action at Targets
1. ![[Pasted image 20230513164005.png|300]]
2. Kidney
	1. Affect either sodium or water resorption to increase plasma volume
	2. Angiotensin II, Aldosterone, Sympathetic activity → ↑ sodium resorption
	3. ADH → ↑ water resorption
3. Heart & Vasculature
	1. Affect cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance to increase blood pressure
	2. Sympathetic activity → Heart → increase cardiac output
	3. Angiotensin II and Sympathetic activity → vasculature → increase total peripheral resistance

#### Angiotensin II
1. Acts at the kidney, adrenal gland, and vasculature
2. ![[Pasted image 20230513164327.png]]
3. Action at the Kidney
	1. Stimulates Na/H exchanger of the proximal tubule to increase resorption of sodium → results in water resorption at proximal tubule
	2. Effect here similar to adding normal saline
4. Action at Adrenal Gland
	1. Stimulates adrenal gland to produce [[Aldosterone]] → increase resorption of sodium in collecting tubule
5. Action at the Vasculature
	1. Potent vasoconstrictor → increase peripheral vascular resistance → increase BP

#### Sympathetic Activity
1. Increases plasma volume and BP by affecting the kidney, producing renin, and affect on heart and vasculature
	1. ![[Pasted image 20230513170149.png]]
	2. Constriction of arteries increases total peripheral resistance and directly increases BP
	3. Constriction of venous vessels increased blood return to the heart → boosts stroke volume → supplementing cardiac output and blood pressure

#### ADH
1. Acts at the kidney to resorb water
2. Only released when substantial drop in BP (10-15 mmHg)
3. Not very effective against [[Hypovolemia]]

## Decrease of Effective Volume
1. Atrial natriuretic peptide is the only volume regulatory hormone that **decreases** effective volume
2. Secreted by the heart in response to volume overload as detected by stretch receptors in the atria
3. ANP increases excretion of sodium from kidney by blocking sodium resorption in the distal nephron
	1. also increases GFR
4. Uncertain physiological effects of ANP
	1. CHF is a/w volume overload and elevated levels of ANP
		1. However, kidney still excretes minimal amounts of sodium
		2. Theory: ANP activity requires normal BP, in CHF BP is usually lower than normal, effect of ANP is blocked


## Clinical Volume Status vs Effective Volume Status
1. Clinical volume status is that which is apparent from clinical assessment
	1. Divided into three categories: [[Hypovolemia|Hypovolemia]], Euvolemia, and Hypervolemia
2. Effective volume depletion can be a/w both [[Hypovolemia]] and hypervolemia
	1. Recall that effective circulating volume = plasma volume + blood pressure
	2. Clinical [[Hypovolemia]] = loss of plasma volume ⇒ diarrhea, vomiting, blood loss → dry mucus membranes, tachycardia, orthostatic vital signs
	3. Clinical hypervolemia = inadequate BP ⇒ peripheral edema → a/w CHF and liver disease
		1. Inadequate BP → depletion of effective circulating volume → peripheral edema
			1. CHF → inadequate cardiac output → inadequate BP
			2. Liver disease → low peripheral vascular resistance → inadequate BP
3. In both [[Hypovolemia]] and hypervolemia, inadequate effective circulating volume stimulates RAAS, sympathetic activity, and if severe, ADH release
### Peripheral Edema
1. Definition: swelling and/or pitting of the skin due to an increase in volume of the *interstitial compartment*
2. Generation of peripheral edema is from an alteration of Starling's Law; Maintenance of peripheral edema is from activation of volume regulatory mechanisms (i.e. RAAS, Sympathetic activity)
	1. Recall from Starling's law that three factors govern the movement of fluid between plasma and interstitial compartments: membrane permeability, hydrostatic pressure, and osmotic pressure
		1. In addition, lymphatic system can also remove interstitial fluid
	2. Increased plasma hydrostatic pressure, decreased plasma osmotic pressure and increased capillary membrane permeability will cause an increase in the movement of water from plasma into the interstitium
	3. Approximately three liters of fluid must move from plasma to interstitium to generate clinically significant edema 
		1. Approximately equal to the volume of the *entire* plasma compartment
	4. To replace this loss of fluid → volume regulatory mechanism activated → sodium retention (RAAS + Sympathetic activity) maintains peripheral edema by replacing plasma fluid lost into the interstitium
#### Peripheral Edema in CHF
1. Formation in CHF is a vicious cycle
	1. ![[Pasted image 20230513172455.png|300]]
2. The low effective circulating volume in CHF → volume regulatory mechanisms
	1. Sympathetic activity → increases cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance + sodium resorption
	2. These mechanism *transiently* restore effective circulating volume but the effects are maladaptive
		1. e.g. Although increased peripheral vascular resistance helps increase BP → it also increases the resistance the heart must pump against (i.e. afterload)
			1. Increased afterload → cardiac dysfunction → further decline in cardiac output → more sympathetic activation and sodium retention → worsening heart failure
	3. Medications used for heart failure, are aimed at blunting the physiologic response to decreased effective circulating volume
		1. ACE-I reduce vasoconstriction (by angiotensin II) and inhibit sodium resorption (by angiotensin II & aldosterone)
		2. Diuretics reduce edema + counteract sodium resorption → reduce plasma volume
			1. Spironolactone is a competitive inhibitor of aldosterone
		3. Beta-blocker inhibit the sympathetic activity
